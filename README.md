## Day 1 Problem Description

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Asked By:** Google  

### Problem Statement:
Given a list of numbers and a number `k`, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to `k`.  

#### Example:
- Input: `[10, 15, 3, 7]`, `k = 17`  
- Output: `True` (since `10 + 7 = 17`)  

**Bonus:** Can you solve this in one pass?  

### Solutions:
1. **Brute Force Solution**: Iterates through all pairs of numbers in the list to check if any two sum to `k`.
2. **Optimized Solution**: Utilizes a set to achieve a more efficient solution in a single pass.

For detailed implementations, see the [solution file](daily#1.py).
